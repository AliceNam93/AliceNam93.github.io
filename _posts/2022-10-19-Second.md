## Understanding The Position Property in CSS
### Why use Position?

To create more complex layout for your website, we use the position property. Position allows you to place the HTML element wherever you want despite their order in HTML code.
There are four types of value in the position. They are: 
> 1.static 
> 2.sticky 
> 3.relative 
> 4.absolute 
> 5.fixed 

In this post, we are going to review the concepts, application, and examples of the later three values.

### 1. position: relative;

**Relative** itself can't perform a positioning . You would need additional properties such as **top, right, bottom, left**
<pre> Example of position: relative; in CSS
<code> div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}</code> 
</pre>
